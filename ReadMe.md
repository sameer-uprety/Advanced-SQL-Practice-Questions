# Advanced SQL Practice Questions

This repository contains a collection of advanced SQL practice questions. These questions were asked in some of the companies I interviewed for data analytics and business intelligence roles in the past. I decided to compile them for reference and to help others who are preparing for similar roles.


## How to Use

You can clone this repository and try solving the SQL questions yourself. All the questions are in 1 `sql` file, and you can run them in any SQL environment that supports the SQL dialect used in the questions (e.g., PostgreSQL).
